# ISPP
December 1 Questions:
- What is the specific role of quality factor (or optical quality factor) in SERS?  
- Does a high quality factor mean a given material is a good SERS substrate?  Does a low quality factor mean a given material is a poor SERS substrate?
- How do we define the quality factor for two materials (e.g. Ag/Au) that support an ISPP?
